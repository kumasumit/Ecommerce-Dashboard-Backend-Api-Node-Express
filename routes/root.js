//1. Sign-Up Api 
//An api with post request to rgister/signup - create a new user in the database

    let result = await user.save();
    //currently result is a json object, we need to convert to object data type
    result.toObject();
    //now result is of type object
    //delete result.password will delete the password key value pair from result object, here result is the object and passoword is the key.
    delete result.password;
    //after saving the created user we send back the created user as response without the password field
    res.send(result);

//2. Log-In Api 
//An api with post request to login - create a new session for sign-up user in the database
router.post("/login", async (req, res)=>{

    const {email, password} = req.body;

        //if no user is found corresponding to entered details
        res.send({result: "Invalid User credentials"})

    }else{
        //if any field email and password is empty
        res.send({result: "Please enter both the fields"})
