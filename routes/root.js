// 5.Delete Product Api
// An Api with delete request to delete specific product with required id from the database
router.delete("/product/:id", async (req, res) => {
    let result = await Product.deleteOne({ _id: req.params.id });
    res.send(result)

// 6.Single Product Detail Api
// An Api with get request to update specific product with required id from the database
router.get("/product/:id", async (req, res) => {

// 7.Update Product Api
// An Api with put request to update specific product with required id from the database
router.put("/product/:id", async (req, res) => {

    let result = await Product.updateOne(
